## *The Batman (2022)*

> I liked The Batman because first, Batman is my most favorite superhero. Second, I find the overall story of The Batman intriguing. Finally, I loved its theme with the grim, dark, gritty, and detective-esque as it resonates with Batman as a character and it was portrayed/executed well by the direction of Mat Reeves.

## *Tropic Thunder (2008)*

> For Tropic Thunder, I freaking loved it because of its hilarious jokes, quips, and the satirical essence. Moreover, the amusing performances of Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and especially Robert Downey Jr. who is a dude playing the dude disguised as another dude.

## *Inglorious Basterds (2009)*

> Inglorious Basterds on the other hand, pretty enjoyable with the historical bits and bobs here and there. With the further addition of Quentin Tarantino's directional magic and signature, I thoroughly enjoyed it since I am also interested in WW2 history especially when it comes to the Nazis. Also, let me mention Cristoph Waltz's phenomenal performance as Col. Hans Landa.

## *Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire (2024)*

> Meanwhile, I added Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire in my list because KAIJUS!!! Who doesn't love Kaijus right? Especially if they're **GODZILLA** and **KING KONG**! Again, it's a movie about **BIG MONSTER ACTION**, hell yeah! Oh, and both the G-Man and Kong rocked in the movie.

## *Ang Pangarap Kong Holdap (2018)*

> As for the last movie in my list, I chose Ang Pangarap Kong Holdap because it's hilarious especially the dick jokes *Golden Phallus, cough*. But the story and plot of the film was good as well not gonna lie. I also considered the actors' performance which are natural. It goes to show the the talent Filipinos possess in acting and that we have the capability to match with foreign countries.
